API Reference
=============

This section provides a comprehensive, automatically generated API reference for the core C code components of the simulation. It details the functions, variables, and data structures used throughout the project, facilitating understanding and development.

Configuration Module
--------------------

The `Configuration Module` (``config.c``) is central to managing global simulation parameters, file pointers, and constant definitions. Its API is primarily documented through its header file, ``config.h``, which contains the `extern` declarations and associated Doxygen comments.
